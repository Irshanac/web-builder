<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This app allows users to type instructions for web components and instantly receive corresponding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code generated by OPENAI CHAT API. Users can preview their code and even make changes directly in the editor, making it easier than ever to fine-tune the appearance and functionality of their website. There is a history function that allows users to revisit previous instructions and code snippets.

Built with `Nextjs` and `Styled Components`
